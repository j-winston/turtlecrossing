<h1>Turtle Crossing</h1>
<img src="turtlecrossing.png">
<p>Get your turtle across the street before he gets hit by a car! This one uses the Turtle Graphics library in python and features progressively difficult levels. Turtle also decided to execute his crossing at 'nigthttime' hoping there'd be less cars. Oh well! </p> 

<p>In a future update, I'd love the cars to change speed independently of one another to add to the challenge factor.</p>
