<h1>Turtle Crossing</h1>
<img src="turtlecrossing.png">
<p>Kinda of like "Crossy Road" but not quite so fun. This one uses the Turtle Graphics library in python and features progressively difficult levels. Turtle also decided to execute his crossing at 'nigthttime' hoping there'd be less cars. Oh well! </p> 

<p>In a future update, I'd love the cars to change speed independently of one another to add to the challenge factor.</p>
